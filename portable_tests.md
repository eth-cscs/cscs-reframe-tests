# How to make your tests more portable

## Features and extras in valid systems and programming environment

In order for tests to be as generic as possible we define the `valid_systems` and `valid_prog_environs` with features that should be defined in the configuration.
More information [in the documentation of ReFrame](https://reframe-hpc.readthedocs.io/en/stable/regression_test_api.html#reframe.core.pipeline.RegressionTest.valid_systems).

Examples of usage:

```python
@rfm.simple_test
class GPUTest(rfm.RegressionTest):
    # Test that will test all the remote partitions (compute nodes) that
    # have an NVIDIA GPU
    valid_systems = ['+nvgpu +remote']
    valid_prog_environs = ['+cuda']
    ...

@rfm.simple_test
class LoginNodesTest(rfm.RegressionTest):
    # Test that will run on the login nodes
    valid_systems = ['-remote']
    ...
```

### Features for partitions

## How to use the value of `extras` in a test

In the configuration of ReFrame, the user can define their own `extras` property in each [partition](https://reframe-hpc.readthedocs.io/en/stable/regression_test_api.html#reframe.core.systems.SystemPartition.extras) and [environment](https://reframe-hpc.readthedocs.io/en/stable/regression_test_api.html#reframe.core.environments.Environment.extras).
The values of these fields are simply objects of type `Dict[str, object]` and they are available in a test after the `setup` phase.

Here is an example how to use these features in a tests:

```python
    @run_after('setup')
    def set_memory(self):
        max_memory = self.current_partition.extras['cn_memory']
        ...

    @run_after('setup')
    def set_compilation_flags(self):
        self.build_system.cflags = self.current_environ.extras['openmp_flags'] + ['-O3']
        ...
```

### Extras for partitions

| Extras | Description | Type | Example value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| cn_memory | Compute node memory | integer | 500 |
| launcher_options | | list[string] | ['--mpi=pmi2']

### Extras for environments

| Extras | Description | Type | Example value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| c_openmp_flags | C OpenMP flags | list[string] | [' -fopenmp'] |
| f_openmp_flags | Fortran OpenMP flags | list[string] | [' -homp'] |
| launcher_options | | list[string] | ['--mpi=pmi2']

## How to use the processor/device specs in a test

Another way to keep your tests as generic as possible is to use the processor information that is collected during the [auto-detection](https://reframe-hpc.readthedocs.io/en/stable/configure.html#auto-detecting-processor-information).
You can find an overview of the available processor information [here](https://reframe-hpc.readthedocs.io/en/stable/config_reference.html#processor-info).

Here is an example from a test:

```python
class MemBandwidthTest(rfm.RunOnlyRegressionTest):
    ...
    @run_before('run')
    def set_processor_properties(self):
        # This is a function that is provided by ReFrame so that the test
        # is automatically skipped when the processor information is not
        # available
        self.skip_if_no_procinfo()

        # The test will get the number of CPUs and numa nodes that Reframe
        # has detected for this partition
        processor_info = self.current_partition.processor
        self.num_cpus_per_task = processor_info.num_cpus
        numa_nodes = processor_info.topology['numa_nodes']

        self.numa_domains = [f'S{i}' for i, _ in enumerate(numa_nodes)]
        self.num_cpu_domain = (
            self.num_cpus_per_task // (len(self.numa_domains) *
                                       self.num_tasks_per_core)
        )
        ...
```

Currently, ReFrame supports auto-detection of the local or remote processor information only.
It does not support auto-detection of devices, in which cases users should explicitly specify this information using the `devices` [configuration option](https://reframe-hpc.readthedocs.io/en/stable/config_reference.html#config.systems.partitions.devices).

## How to run Container Engine(CE) based tests

To run a Container Engine (CE) based test, it is essential to create a test class inheriting from the `ContainerEngineMixin` and add the `ce` as one of the `valid_system` features.
The aforementioned mixin class handles the necessary complexity to create a .toml environment file.
The only requirement is the assignment of an actual container image to the `container_image` class variable.
Furthermore, the following optional container related variables are also supported:

* `container_workdir`: the working directory of the container (`/rfm_workdir` is used by default).
* `container_mounts`: a list of container mount pairs of the form <src directory>:<target directory> (ReFrame will always mount the stage directory under `/rfm_workdir` inside the container).
* `container_env_key_values`: a dictionary of key value pairs to be passed to the TOML environment definition.
* `container_env_table`: a dictionary where the keys are the headers of the TOML table and the values are dictionaries with key/value pairs of the corresponding table.

At the moment only `RunOnlyRegressionTest` type tests should be used for CE-based tests.

## Continuous Integration

Testing of CPE and UENV software stacks is automated using CSCS CI. A list of the current ReFrame tests integrated in the CI can be found here:
